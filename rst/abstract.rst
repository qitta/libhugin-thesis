metadata search and analysis system *libhugin*. Additionally the behavior of the
system under various circumstances is analyzed. Apart that all metadata sources
used by *libhugin* are evaluated. The purpose of the analysis of the metadata
sources is to evaluate all previously assumptions made. Another purpose of this

    Abstract
    ========

This paper demonstrates a way to build a modular movie metadata retrieval and
analysis library. The main purpose of this library is to retrieve and postprocess
movie metadata by user needs, making the user less dependent to a specific
metadata source or metadata tool. In order to demonstrate and test the library
two command line tools are implemented. By using those command line tools a user
may test plugins, but also use the library for scripting tasks. There is also a
RESTful webservice, for usage with XBMC, implemented.
